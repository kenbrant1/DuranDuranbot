<!--begin article here-->
by Dan Eden for Viewzone<p>

<b>EDITOR: We have some important new information on the TimeWave 
predictions at the end of this article. So many people did not read this
 story when it was first published on viewzone that we thought it 
important to repost it with the new data.</b></p><p>
I have a very good friend named Johnny who lives in Patagonia, one of 
the safest places on the planet. He often sends me ideas for stories on 
viewzone. A while back he tried to get me interested in something called
 the "Time Wave Theory." My initial reaction was to pass on the story. A
 theory about time? Einstein couldn't define what time is (or was, or 
will be). </p><p>

<img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_008.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200">The Timewave theory, put forth by Terence McKenna [<b>right</b>],
 is further complicated by the fact that he is dead, and that much of 
what he learned about the theory is alleged to have come to him during 
shamanic visionary states while he was living in the Amazon jungle. 
Hmmm.</p><p>

But The Timewave Theory is perhaps the hottest topic on the internet 
today. Many reputable scientists and physicists have embraced it. It has
 broken the barriers between esoteric philosophy and pragmaticism. And, 
as you will see, its discovery is predicted within the theory itself.</p><p>

Lots of trendy websites have given summaries of McKenna's theories, 
especially as they relate to 2012, but hardly anyone has explained the 
theory in a logical way. Since that is my <i>raison d'etre</i> here on viewzone, I will attempt to do this now.</p><p>

The biography of Terence McKenna is fascinating and certainly worth 
exploring, but I will leave that for later. Our story begins in China 
about 4000 years ago with a phenomenon called the I-Ching.</p><p>

<b>The I-Ching</b></p><p>

The Chinese people are great at understanding abstractions. Their 
writing consists of symbols that suggest an idea or concept rather than 
phonetic sounds, like English. With hundreds of different dialects 
spoken in China, often people living in a neighboring village cannot 
understand the spoken language of their countrymen. Although the sounds 
and phonetics may vary, the written Chinese symbols are understood by 
everyone. Why is this important?</p><p>

The I-Ching is a system for what the Western mind would call "fortune 
telling." But instead of being able to tell you who you will marry, when
 you will die or next week's lottery numbers, the I-Ching predicts the 
pattern of events which will govern and shape your destiny. It's an 
abstract vignette  of a universal influence for a specific block of 
time.</p><p>

In the I-Ching, there are patterns which are composed of six 
possibilities, represented by either a broken line (yin) or a solid line
 (yang). By simple mathematics it is easy to understand that two 
possible patterns, expressed in a matrix of six (called a hexagram), 
yield a possibility of exactly 64 different hexagrams.</p><p>

Typically, if you are in Asia and engage the I-Ching, you will toss a 
coin six times and record the heads or tails (yin or yang) and arrive at
 one of these 64 hexagrams. By referencing the Book of I-Ching, you will
 be able to ascertain the flow of events that governs your present and 
future life. The results will not be specific -- it's more of a kind of 
weather report describing the outcome of your actions.</p><p>

So why is this important to the Timewave Theory? It's not, really. The 
I-Ching is a kind of parlor game that evolved from something deeper and 
more significant. The true basis of the I-Ching was understood many 
thousands of years ago and was lost in centuries of ignorance and 
political upheaval -- that is until Terence McKenna accidentally 
stumbled upon it in the 1970s.</p><p>

<b>The hexagrams</b></p><p>

Examining the King Wen I-Ching hexagrams, McKenna noticed an obvious 
pattern. The first hexagram contains six solid lines. Hexagram number 
two has six broken lines. Hexagrams 3 and 4 appear to be similar pairs 
that have been rotated 180 degrees. The same is true for most of the 
other hexagrams -- they are pairs in which the second hexagram has been 
rotated 180 degrees.</p><p></p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_003.gif"></center><p>

McKenna noticed that sometimes, when a hexagram was supposed to be 
rotated, the rotation would not change the configuration. An example of 
this can be seen in hexagram 27. It also is the case with seven other 
hexagrams (#1, 2, 28, 29, 30, 61 and 62). When this happens there is a 
different rule that applies. The following hexagram is exactly opposite 
-- the yins become yangs and visa versa.</p><p>

McKenna then focused his attention on the number of lines that changed 
in each subsequent hexagram, moving from the first to the sixty-fourth. 
From hexagram 1 to 2 there were six changed lines, from hexagram 2 to 3 
there were two, then four, and four again...</p><p>

He plotted these changes on a graph and arrived at a unique pattern. </p><p>

</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_004.gif"></center>

<p>
But he didn't make much sense out of this. He needed to understand why 
the I-Ching was made of six lines and why was it arranged in pairs that 
were rotated 180 degrees. The breakthrough came when he noticed that the
 extreme left and right of the graph contained a saw-tooth pattern. If 
he copied the graph, rotated it 180 degrees and superimposed it on the 
original graph it meshed perfectly "like the dove tail of a cabinet 
maker."</p><p>

</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave.gif"></center>

<p>

To incorporate the six lines, McKenna repeated this new graph six times 
and superimposed it on the single plot. To incorporate the phenomenon of
 "pairs" of hexagrams, he repeated the pattern two times and 
superimposed it on the other two graphs. Eventually he arrived at a 
complex shape containing all three graphs. But what did this mean?</p><p>

</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_002.gif"></center><p>


With a computer it was possible to combine the peaks and valleys and arrive at an average graph (see math at <a href="http://www.fractal-timewave.com/math_twz.htm">http://www.fractal-timewave.com/math_twz.htm</a>),
 representing the change of the 64 hexagrams and, as McKenna believed, 
revealing the secret encoded in their original design. This graph has 
become known as the Timewave.</p><p>

<img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave1.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">

<b>Confused?</b></p><p>

It is difficult for a Western mind to comprehend abstracts. In our 
everyday lives we ignore things that don't have immediate relevance, yet
 we do have many abstracts that we take for granted. Good and evil, 
light and darkness, love and hate -- these are opposite abstracts that 
we would have difficulty describing without using both words in the 
pair. Good is the absence of evil, darkness is the absence of light. 
Even in physics we have matter and anti-matter, positive and negative 
charges... </p><p>

In Asian Taoism philosophy the concept of opposing phenomena is 
represented by the Yin and Yang. Both are always present in everything, 
yet the amount of influence of each varies over time. </p><p></p><center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10"><tbody><tr><td width="700" bgcolor="#ddccee"><span class="verdana9">
<b>The nature of yin-yang</b><p>
<img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/yin-yang.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="250">
In Taoist philosophy, yin and yang arise together from an initial 
quiescence or emptiness (wuji, sometimes symbolized by an empty circle),
 and continue moving in tandem until quiescence is reached again. For 
instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously 
raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high
 and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement 
dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin–yang, thus, are always 
opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its 
peak it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: 
grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce 
seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.</p><p>

It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the
 opposite, since yin–yang are bound together as parts of a mutual 
whole. A race with only men or only women would disappear in a single 
generation; but men and women together create new generations that allow
 the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The 
interaction of the two gives birth to things. Yin and yang transform 
each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented
 by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will 
sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky - an 
intrinsically yang movement. Then when it reaches its full potential 
height it will descend.</p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
   


The individual lines of the I-Ching are made up of both Yin (broken 
lines) and Yang (solid lines). The concept of change and balance is 
inherent in the hexagrams. McKenna understood that his final graph must 
contain the "fingerprint" of change contained in time itself.</p><p>

The peaks represent the abstraction of "stasis" or habitual stability, while the valleys represent novelty or change.</p><p>

<b>Fractals anyone?</b></p><p>

A fractal is a shape produced by plotting mathematical data which 
repeats whether viewed on a macro or micro scale. McKenna realized that 
his Time Wave had this special characteristic. The entire graph, 
representing the beginning and end of time, can be seen duplicated when 
one looks at a smaller span of time.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_007.jpg"></center><p><span class="verdana9"><i>In
 the example above the same pattern can be seen for plotting two 
differnt eras. The bottom plot spans almost 150 years while the top plot
 spans about 1.5 years.</i></span></p><p><span class="verdana10">

The drama of novelty and habit plays out, according to the Timewave, in a
 specific and orderly pattern. Because this pattern is a fractal, the 
ups and downs of the timewave apply equally to a long epoch, like the 
emergence of life on our panet, and a short epoch, like the lifetime of 
an individual. </span></p><p>

<img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_009.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="300">


McKenna liked to joke about this phenomenon in his lectures. He would 
use the example of the fall of the Roman Empire, saying that it followed
 the same pattern -- habit and novelty -- as when he vacuumed his living
 room. </p><p>


Understanding this "fractal" concept makes it easier to understand why 
the I-Ching was used to predict the outcome of current events in Chinese
 philosophy. If one could learn where on the Timewave they were then 
they could infer whether novelty or habit were in play.</p><p> 

<b>Time compression</b></p><p>

As the Timewave pattern moves through time, the fractals become smaller 
and smaller. What took eons of time to complete next takes only 
thousands of years, then hundreds, then days, minutes, seconds. As we 
approach the zero point on the grand Timewave, waves of novelty and 
habit change more rapidly. This can appear chaotic to our sense of time 
but it is because the very <i>pattern</i> of time IS speeding up.</p><p>

Indeed the knowledge and understanding that we have accomplished in the 
last hundred years of civilization far surpasses the achievements of 
many thousands of years before. It is not so surprising then that the 
Timewave theory should be discovered, or perhaps re-discovered, at this 
fast paced era near the end of time. </p><p> 

<b>What is novelty?</b></p><p>
Novelty is characterized by increased activity and options. For humans, 
this usually follows some great discovery or event which changes our 
behavior. Imagine an ant's nest where workers go about their daily 
routine of foraging for food. All of a sudden a sugar cube is dropped on
 the ant mound and suddenly the behavior of the nest changes to take 
advantage of this new opportunity. If the discovery is significant 
enough the ant colony may have enough food for many weeks, thereby 
ushering in a period of stability and wellbeing. Novelty ushers in 
stability and visa versa.</p><p>

Novelty and stability may appear opposite but they are always present in
 time. The Timewave plots the move from one direction to the other. 
Moving up indicates a gradual increase in stability and organization 
while a downward curve shows that some new factors are influencing 
change. It's a continuous ebb and flow.</p><p>

I thought it would be helpful to take a look at the Timewave for the past two decades.</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_002.jpg"></center><p>

The above timewave begins on February 1992 and ends on December 21, 
2012. Yes, it's "doomsday" but we'll talk about that later. I have 
marked some events that happened close to the significant turning points
 -- either just before a downward or upward curve. I will let you decide
 if these events validate their position on the graph.</p><p>

<b>Doomsday</b></p><p>

When he finally arrived at the shape of the Timewave, McKenna then had 
to superimpose it on historical events. He placed the beginning of the 
wave at the theoretical beginning of the universe, more than 15 billion 
years ago. Here, the Timewave graph began at zero and spiked up to reach
 a high degree of organization. As he plotted the wave he realized that 
it eventually reached zero at the end. Further, this end was in our 
present era!</p><p>

The last harmonic of the wave has a duration of 67.29 years, marked 
again by some dramatic event at the onset of the pattern. At first 
McKenna placed this event with the dropping of the atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima. This worked out to the graph reaching zero in mid-November of
 2012. Later, when he learned of the end date of the Mayan calendar, he 
adjusted the wave to coincide with this time.</p><p>

According to the Timewave theory, on December 21, 2012 we will be in the
 unique position in time where we will experience maximum novelty -- 
maximum potential for change. Not since the birth of our universe has 
this happened. What will follow this date is something that we cannot 
imagine. The next day, if time recycles, will usher in incredible order 
and organization. Will we be part of this? </p><p>

<b>Terence McKenna, November 16, 1949 to April 3, 2000</b><p>

<img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">Following
 the death of his mother in 1971, Terence, his brother Dennis, and three
 friends traveled to the Colombian Amazon in search of oo-koo-he, a 
plant preparation containing DMT. Instead of oo-koo-he they found 
various forms of ayahuasca and gigantic psilocybe cubensis which became 
the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, at the urging of his 
brother, he allowed himself to be the subject of a psychedelic 
experiment which he claimed put him in contact with <i>Logos</i>: an 
informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary 
religious experience. The revelations of this voice, and his brother's 
peculiar experience during the experiment, prompted him to explore the 
structure of an early form of the I Ching, which led to his "Novelty 
Theory". These ideas were explored extensively by Terence and Dennis in 
their 1975 book <i>The Invisible Landscape - Mind Hallucinogens and The I Ching</i>.</p><p>

In the early 1980s, McKenna began to speak publicly on the topic of 
psychedelic drugs, lecturing extensively and conducting weekend 
workshops. Timothy Leary once introduced him as "one of the five or six 
most important people on the planet".</p><p></p><blockquote>
"It's clearly a crisis of two things: of consciousness and conditioning.
 These are the two things that the psychedelics attack. We have the 
technological power, the engineering skills to save our planet, to cure 
disease, to feed the hungry, to end war; But we lack the intellectual 
vision, the ability to change our minds. We must decondition ourselves 
from 10,000 years of bad behavior. And, it's not easy." -- Terence 
McKenna, <i>This World...and Its Double</i></blockquote><p>
</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_005.jpg"></center><p>
He soon became a fixture of popular counterculture, and his popularity 
continued to grow, culminating in the early to mid 1990s with the 
publication of several books such as <i>True Hallucinations</i> (which relates the tale of his 1971 experience at La Chorrera), <i>Food of the Gods</i> and <i>The Archaic Revival</i>.
 He became a popular personality in the psychedelic rave/dance scene of 
the early 1990s, with frequent spoken word performances at raves and 
contributions to psychedelic and goa trance albums by The Shamen, 
Spacetime Continuum, Alien Project, Capsula, Entheogenic, Zuvuya, 
Shpongle, and Shakti Twins. His speeches were (and continue to be) 
sampled by many others. In 1994 he appeared as a speaker at the Starwood
 Festival, which was documented in the book Tripping by Charles Hayes 
(his lectures were produced on both cassette tape and CD).</p><p>

McKenna was a contemporary and colleague of chaos mathematician Ralph 
Abraham and biologist Rupert Sheldrake (creator of the theory of 
"morphogenetic fields", not to be confused with the mainstream usage of 
the same term), and conducted several public debates known as trialogues
 with them, from the late 1980s up until his death. Books which 
contained transcriptions of some of these events were published. He was 
also a friend and associate of Ralph Metzner, Nicole Maxwell, and Riane 
Eisler, participating in joint workshops and symposia with them. He was a
 personal friend of Tom Robbins, and influenced the thought of numerous 
scientists, writers, artists, and entertainers, including comedian Bill 
Hicks, whose routines concerning psychedelic drugs drew heavily from 
McKenna's works. He is also the inspiration for the Twin Peaks character
 Dr. Jacoby.

</p><p>

McKenna also co-founded Botanical Dimensions with Kathleen Harrison 
(ethnobotanist) (his colleague and wife of 17 years), a non-profit 
ethnobotanical preserve on the island of Hawaii, where he lived for many
 years before he died. Before moving to Hawaii permanently, McKenna 
split his time between Hawaii and a town called Occidental, located in 
the redwood-studded hills of Sonoma County, California, a town unique 
for its high concentration of artistic notables, including Tom Waits and
 Mickey Hart.

</p><p>

Of all his many accomplishments, Terence McKenna will be remembered for 
his discovery of the Timewave Novelty Theory and his unparalleled 
ability to describe this theory to others in a way that made it 
interesting, understandable and congruent with both physics and 
religion.</p><p>

As physicists look deeper and further in to the infinity of quantum 
mechanics, McKenna's work on the structure of time is gaining more 
respect and application. While some conservative minds will condemn his 
use of mind-altering drugs, it is perhaps because of the other-worldly 
nature of these psychedelic experiences that the abstractions of time 
were revealed.</p><p>
We can only wait and see.</p><p>
</p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p> 
<b>UPDATES AND IMPORTANT PREDICTIONS FOR 2010+</b></p><p>

First, I don't want to make this too complex. If you're like me, keeping
 your credit card in balance is tough enough to do. Although I have 
spent hours trying to understand the complexities of the Time Wave 
Theory, I can grasp enough to write about it in the most general way.</p><p>
One of the steps in McKenna's process that I described in the previous 
article -- where he took the first graph and reversed it -- has always 
bothered me. When he placed this reversed graph on top of the existing 
graph he aligned it in such a way that the "teeth" meshed. But they were
 not meshed exactly and this left little bits of the graph on both ends 
slightly misaligned with each other.</p><p>

Apparently someone else noticed this. A British mathematician named 
Mathew Watkins saw this discrepancy and decided to be more precise with 
this alignment. He aligned the reverse graph with the existing graph and
 let the numbers decide what happened. It wasn't visually pretty like 
McKenna's TimeWave, but it was mathematically sound.</p><p>

The result is what has become known as the Watkins Objection, and the 
resulting Time Wave pattern is only slightly different. But when you are
 dealing with things like time and events, a small difference can be 
quite significant.</p><p>

Let's look at the Time Waves for the "standard model" proposed by 
McKenna for the dates March 31, 2010 through the "end of time" on 
12/21/2012 and compare them to the Watkins model for the same period:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_006.jpg"><p><b>Above: the standard model proposed by McKenna.</b></p><p>
<img src="Terence%20McKenna%27s%20Time%20Wave%20Novelty%20Theory_files/timewave_003.jpg"></p><p><b>Above: The Watkins model showing adjusted calculations.</b></p></center><p>

In the standard model we see that there is an event which will happen 
around May 9th which will begin a period of habitual behavior that 
culminates on July 8th. From July 9th onward we are in a steep plunge of
 novelty which placed everyone in a state of confusion as they adjust to
 some new situation that has been thrust upon humanity. Around January 
16th of 2011 we get a small reprieve and begin to cope with the new 
situation but in March 22 of 2011 something again happens that causes 
unrest and novelty. There are a few attempts to adjust to normalcy after
 this date, but eventually the situation becomes too much and absolute 
novelty overcomes habit on 12/21/2012.</p><p>

In the revised Watkins model we see that May 9th is also a significant 
day, marking our climb to habitual life that, like the McKenna model, 
changes on July 8th. But instead of a sharp decline into novelty, the 
Watkins model has a sawtooth pattern of adjustment with increasing 
habitual behavior, suggesting that humanity is coping well with some 
change. This happens until November 14th, at which time a free fall into
 novelty happens which is even greater than the one predicted by 
McKenna. It goes straight down until January 16, 2011. After January 
16th there is a brief period of recovery and habitual behavior that 
reaches it peak on March 22, 2011. Then, something happens that takes 
humanity to maximum novelty on 12,21,2012.</p><p>

So, while the significant dates remain the same, the pattern of habitual
 behavior vs. coping with new situations in new ways is slightly 
different.</p><p>

One thing that was discovered with the Watkins model is that the Time 
Wave has absolute novelty both at the beginning and the end of the wave.
 This suggests that there might be some cyclical nature to the wave, and
 time itself.</p><p>


</p><blockquote>
Why does this matter, you may ask, since there are many obvious 
differences between the two waves -- what is the significance of this 
difference? For the <i>standard model wave</i>, it has been argued that 
the zero value at the end of the waveform implies some kind of 
singularity at the end of the process -- or at the end of time. This <i>revised wave</i> is implying, however, that there may be singularities at <i>both</i> ends of the continuum. This is also an argument for a <i>closed</i>
 system that may be undergoing some kind of cyclic renewal process -- 
perhaps each cycle expressing ever higher ordered states of complex 
form, or <i>Novelty</i>.<p>There are concepts emerging from the field of
 quantum cosmology that may describe an analogous cyclic process. This 
is a theory in which universes are treated like quantum particles that 
inhabit a larger, or higher dimentional domain called a <i>multiuniverse</i>.
 Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist and co-founder of string field 
theory, has described a process where universes emerge from zero-point, 
or vacuum field, go through an evolutionary process, then perhaps return
 to zero-point field at the end of the cycle. This cycle may then repeat
 itself, possibly with increased complexity and <i>Novelty</i>. So could this be similar to the process that the <i>TimeWave</i> and <i>Novenly Theory</i>
 attempt to reveal? Perhaps further incestigation into the nature of the
 TimeWave will shed some light on these questions." --John Sheliak

<b>Comments:</b></p><p>Dear Dan,<br><br>
 
Thanks for your article on Terence McKenna's Time-Wave Theory. There's more to discuss.<br><br>
 
I met Terence on the Big Island in July 1988 at a Physical Immortality 
Conference before he was very well known, but nonetheless a dynamic and 
inspiring, extremely articulate and compelling speaker.  He invited a 
few of us to his home to see his Botanical Reserve and we hung out with 
him after touring it, in his hot tub with his son and we talked about 
everything, which he was excelled at.  In addition to being exceedingly 
bright, he was also exceedingly funny.  He had a real penchant for dry 
humor, the paradoxical and the ironic.  Painting a picture of Terence 
without including these elements does not capture a true picture of 
Terence.<br><br>
 
We maintained a loose contact over the next few years, and in 1992, I 
took a workshop with him in NYC attended by all of about 15 of us, 
focusing on entheogens, or better, the ingestion of sacred plants for 
consciousness expansion and then the following year at the Open Center 
in NYC, attended by about 20 of us, this time on time, yes, the Timewave
 Theory.  It was and is fascinating, and also, as he said, he was always
 looking to disprove it and testing it every which way. <br><br>
 
In around 1994, a year after I began producing and hosting a NYC-based, 
educational TV show called A Better World (www.abetterworld.net) I 
invited Terence on as a guest (it's on DVD through the website) and this
 was a fascinating interview focusing on the Time-Wave software.  I can 
tell you why Timothy Leary said of him that he was one of the greatest 
minds of the 20th century: because it's true.  His understanding, as 
expressed in his lectures and books, show a vast, holistic perspective 
of the interconnectedness of life, love, plants and the inner workings 
of the Universe.  It's worth any interested party to get hold of his 
work and really bear down on it.<br><br>
 
I'm telling you all of this to say that open and experimental as he was,
 he himself was surprised when it worked but always assumed that there 
would be found some flaw in it eventually.  In short, playful and 
serious as he was about it, he also seemed to entertain the potential 
for its being shown at some point to be inaccurate or inherently flawed.
  I don't know of anyone who has disproven it, but I do know of someone 
who may have exceeded it.<br><br>
 
At the seminar in 1993, a small group of us joined Terence for lunch.  
One fellow, who sat next to Terence, David Katzmire, spent most of the 
lunch downloading to Terence a theory of time that he developed called 
Kalarhythms.  He was actually originally looking to plot cycles of 
stocks rising and falling, but ended up re-dating the birth of the U.S. 
and evolving a time-cycle theory that is globally-encompassing and 
highly predictive with accuracy across a few parameters: there's a 
physical, emotional, mental/intellectual and a spiritual cycle.  These 
interweave across time per their own cycles and at their intersection, 
rather interesting dynamics predictably arise.  At that lunch, Terence 
not only politely listened, but seemed to be quite intrigued, if not 
entranced, by this other approach to the subject.  It factored in 
variables that Terence seemingly hadn't considered, and he accorded 
David's theory a good deal of consideration.  It was quite an 
interesting lunch.<br><br>
 
Thereafter, yes, I spent some more time with Terence at lectures, 
workshops, on my show, here and there, and I deeply value this precious 
time with him, especially in light of his passing only a few short years
 thereafter, much to the dismay of those of us who knew him even 
minimally.  He was brilliant and helped to open the minds of thousands 
due to his alluring, humorous and poetic style of extraordinary 
delivery.  Open as he was in so many ways, curiously, when it came to 
treatment of his brain tumor, he seemed rather committed to the 
allopathic approach and didn't seem to give much attention to 
alternatives, despite his Berkelely-based, alternative and progressive 
thinking that characterized him.<br><br>
 
The work of David Katzmire, which I discovered, ironically, through 
attending one of Terence's workshops, at this point is much less known 
but no less meritorious.  In fact, it is a growing body of evidence 
about the nature of time cycles and how they can help us generate a 
greater perspective on what's currently going on as novelty does 
increase, as time is speeding up, and during a time when the first part 
of chaos theory, namely, the rein of chaos, seems dominant.  Of course, 
the use of Kalarhythms, I have found, and have further corroborated 
through my series of interview with Katzmire, both on A Better World TV 
and Radio over the past few years, has deepened my own understanding of 
'what's happening' and the underlying order beneath it.  And I would 
turn your and your audience's attention in that direction to learn more 
about it.  From my view, this should be the more hotly debated 
time-cycle theory on the net because even Terence recognized its value, 
even possibly as a more thorough approach to understanding time cycles 
than his own.<br><br>
 
Not to mention, its author, David Katzmire, is very much with us, to 
further expand the work and to educate us, parry with us, about it with 
artful glee.<br><br>
 
The interested reader can find a radio show of mine with David as a free
 download at: www.abetterworld.net under the Media link (and just scroll
 down until you see it) and on DVD at the same site under the Store 
link(not free) and a few minutes of each on YouTube at: 
abetterworldtvshow.<br><br>
 
I hold Terence McKenna to be "penseur extraordinaire" as we used to 
refer to him, and his contribution as a 
thinker/philosopher/educator/provocateur invaluable.  What he helped us 
see about the intimate relationship between psyche and soma, mind and 
plant and planet is nothing short of brilliant, and the more who know of
 him/his work, the more sentient life benefits.  He is one of my 
favorite people--and guests--of all time.  But when it comes to 
understanding cycles of time, I would refer you to the work of 
Kalarhythms.<br><br>
 
I hope this missive is somewhat informative and helpful.<br><br>
 
Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information.<br><br>

There is a question of why T. McKenna, as such a farsighted man, didn't 
avail himself of say, energy medicine, or another of the proven cures 
against cancer, e.g essiac, a herbal cure. (I have tried this on a skin 
cancer. It got rid of the cancer, as per the prognosis.) Perhaps he 
wanted it that way because his mission goals had been achieved; meaning 
that he could Go Home!! This is simply another angle, a possibility I am
 looking at, something already outlined in Songs Of Power. This has to 
do directly with the activation of the mechanism which will set in 
motion the acceleration of the Harmonic Vibrations, all the harmonic 
scale, as part of the RAISING OF THE LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS. You see, it
 could be that the raising of the level of consciousness, ties in nicely
 with 12/21/2012. If all consciousness is raised, that just could usher 
in the new beginning, as has been hinted at, (and obliquely stated in 
Omens &amp; Hindsight, which encapsulates excerpts from Songs Of Power; 
obtainable at bookhabit.com),  by way of the building of the peaks of 
habituation, then the abrupt swooping rush via novelty into troughs, 
perhaps into a new situation, whereby the rate of vibration is induced 
to accelerate; thereby is the uplifting of all consciousness 
accomplished. Sigh!! It's only an intense wish, a warrior's wish. Is it 
so foolish to pray that all will be uplifted into a new paradigm? A type
 of existence wherein all are benefited in every conceivable way? 
Anyway, that is the bones of what I term my Prayer, my Karakea. And why 
should not my Life be my Prayer also? My Karakea!! Every good I could 
ever wish for myself I wish for everyone and everything that can sense 
the winds of change- the Four Winds, Te Nga Hoe Wha. So I pray to help 
make it so. Not far from where I live, is an ancient place of Power, Te 
Meringa Te Kakara. Now the ground might be about prepared so the changes
 will take place in accord with the raising of the frequency of 
vibration, which causes the raising of consciousness to a higher level 
of vibration. Everything is touched and all that is touched with these 
all pervading vibrations is changed, is raised to a higher or purer 
vibration.</p><p>
Maybe not, there may be many computations. Still, I live my Prayer and I'll see where it takes me.
Mes Braves, Bon Voyage - Happy Landings. </p><p>
